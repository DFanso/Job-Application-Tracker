# Security Policy

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Policy for Job Application Tracker

We take security seriously in the Job Application Tracker project. This document outlines our security practices and how to report security vulnerabilities.

## üö® Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

### How to Report

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

**DO NOT** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.

### Reporting Methods

1. **Email (Preferred)**
   - **Email**: guestpc87@gmail.com
   - **Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the vulnerability
   - **Encryption**: Use our PGP key if available

2. **GitHub Security Advisory**
   - Use GitHub's [Private Vulnerability Reporting](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability)
   - This ensures the report is handled privately

### What to Include

When reporting a security vulnerability, please include:

- **Description**: Clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Potential impact and severity
- **Steps to Reproduce**: Detailed steps to reproduce the issue
- **Environment**: Affected versions and configurations
- **Proof of Concept**: If applicable, include a proof of concept
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have ideas for fixing the issue

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial Assessment**: Within 72 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 1 week
- **Resolution**: As quickly as possible (typically 1-4 weeks)

## üîí Security Measures

### Authentication & Authorization

- **JWT Tokens**: Secure token-based authentication
- **Password Hashing**: bcrypt with appropriate salt rounds
- **Session Management**: Secure session handling
- **Role-Based Access**: Proper authorization checks

### Data Protection

- **Encryption at Rest**: Sensitive data encrypted in database
- **Encryption in Transit**: HTTPS/TLS for all communications
- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive input validation and sanitization
- **SQL Injection Prevention**: Parameterized queries and ORM usage

### API Security

- **Rate Limiting**: API rate limiting to prevent abuse
- **CORS Configuration**: Proper CORS settings
- **Request Validation**: Input validation on all endpoints
- **Error Handling**: Secure error messages without sensitive information

### Infrastructure Security

- **Dependency Scanning**: Regular dependency vulnerability scanning
- **Security Headers**: Appropriate security headers
- **Logging**: Comprehensive security event logging
- **Monitoring**: Security monitoring and alerting

## üõ†Ô∏è Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Secure Coding Practices**
   - Follow secure coding guidelines
   - Validate all inputs
   - Use parameterized queries
   - Implement proper error handling

2. **Dependency Management**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use security scanning tools
   - Review dependency changes

3. **Code Review**
   - Security-focused code reviews
   - Look for common vulnerabilities
   - Test security features

### For Users

1. **Authentication**
   - Use strong, unique passwords
   - Enable two-factor authentication when available
   - Keep credentials secure

2. **Data Handling**
   - Be cautious with sensitive information
   - Use secure connections
   - Report suspicious activity

## üîç Security Testing

### Automated Testing

- **Dependency Scanning**: Automated vulnerability scanning
- **SAST**: Static Application Security Testing
- **DAST**: Dynamic Application Security Testing
- **Container Scanning**: Docker image vulnerability scanning

### Manual Testing

- **Penetration Testing**: Regular security assessments
- **Code Review**: Security-focused code reviews
- **Threat Modeling**: Regular threat model updates

## üìã Vulnerability Disclosure

### Disclosure Process

1. **Private Disclosure**: Vulnerabilities are reported privately
2. **Investigation**: Security team investigates and validates
3. **Fix Development**: Fix is developed and tested
4. **Coordinated Disclosure**: Fix is released with disclosure
5. **Public Disclosure**: Vulnerability is publicly disclosed

### Disclosure Timeline

- **0-30 days**: Private investigation and fix development
- **30-90 days**: Coordinated disclosure with affected parties
- **90+ days**: Public disclosure (if not already disclosed)

## üè∑Ô∏è Security Labels

### Issue Labels

- `security` - Security-related issues
- `vulnerability` - Security vulnerabilities
- `security-enhancement` - Security improvements
- `security-audit` - Security audit findings

### Severity Levels

- **Critical**: Immediate threat, requires urgent attention
- **High**: Significant security risk, should be addressed quickly
- **Medium**: Moderate security risk, should be addressed soon
- **Low**: Minor security risk, can be addressed in normal cycle
